Name: Mr X Decision: No direction for release INTRODUCTION Mr X's case was referred to the Parole Board by the Secretary of State for Justice for consideration of whether it would be appropriate to direct his release or in the alternative if the panel would recommend to the Secretary of State that he could be progressed into an open prison. The case was considered at an oral hearing on 29 May 2018. The panel could only direct release if it was satisfied that it was no longer necessary for the protection of the public that Mr X remained confined in prison. If the panel did not find that Mr X could be released, it must make a balanced assessment of the risks and benefits of transfer to open conditions and provide a recommendation to the Secretary of State. In reaching its decision, the panel took into account the contents of Mr X's dossier, of 248 pages, which was prepared by the Secretary of State. At the hearing, the panel heard oral evidence from Mr X's Offender Supervisor based in the prison; the Offender Manager based in the community and the prison based psychologist. Mr X also gave evidence to the panel and was questioned in detail by panel members. Mr X was legally represented at the hearing. SENTENCE DETAILS In July 1996 Mr X received a Life Sentence following conviction for murder and a determinate sentence of 7 years for grievous bodily harm (GBH) against another person. Mr X became eligible to be considered for release in July 2013 when his tariff of 18 years expired. RISK ASSESSMENT Having considered Mr X's offending and the evidence presented, the panel considered Mr X's risk factors to include the use of instrumental violence; weapons; the use of violence within a domestic setting; jealousy within relationships; possessiveness; unhelpful ways of thinking; manipulative behaviour; a lack of remorse or guilt; a lack of empathy; and a

failure to take responsibility for his actions. The panel considered him to be a high risk of serious harm. Evidence was presented concerning successful completion of programmes to address victim awareness; social and life skills; conflict resolution and some individual work with a psychologist on the GBH offence. The panel was told that this was stopped because Mr X was engaging superficially and not internalising the learning. He has not undertaken any specific accredited offending behaviour programmes that would be designed to address his use of weapons, violence or of the use of violence in relationships. Mr X has not been able to demonstrate the application of those skills while in custody. Witnesses described Mr X's risks, some protective factors and how he needed to be tested in a different type of prison. They acknowledged that it was difficult to be sure of all the risks given the approach Mr X has taken to his convictions. Mr X himself said that he felt ready for open prison conditions. The panel noted that Mr X has continued to deny the offences and that the body of the murder victim has never been found. The panel deemed protective factors in this case to be unclear. Mr X has the support of his family who have kept in contact, but noted that they all believe in his innocence and it was unclear how protective they might be if released into the community. Where protective factors were identified by witnesses, the panel concluded that these were present prior to the offences and so were unsure how reliable they were in the postconviction context. All professional witnesses were not in support of release. All did support a move to an open prison to test Mr X in less secure conditions. DECISION After considering the circumstances of offending, the progress made while in custody, and the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel were not satisfied that Mr X was suitable for release. The panel concluded that it was still necessary for the protection of the public that he remained in a closed prison and were not satisfied that on balance there was benefit and effective enough risk management in an open prison and declined to recommend this option to the Secretary of State.
