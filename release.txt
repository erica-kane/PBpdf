Name: Mr X Decision: Release INTRODUCTION Mr X's case was referred to the Parole Board by the Secretary of State for Justice to consider Mr X's suitability for release. The case was considered at an oral hearing in October 2017 and then again in May 2018, once further information had been received. The panel could only direct Mr X's release if it was satisfied that it was no longer necessary for the protection of the public that he remained confined in prison. In reaching its decision, the panel took into account the contents of Mr X's dossier of 356 pages, prepared by the Secretary of State. At the hearing, the panel heard oral evidence from Mr X's Offender Supervisor and his Offender Manager. The panel also heard evidence from Mr X, who was legally represented for the hearing. The panel also had the benefit of four victim personal statements, which the panel considered carefully. Some of the information which the panel had access to could not be shared with Mr X. SENTENCE DETAILS In September 2010, Mr X received a determinate sentence of 16 years following conviction for multiple sexual offences committed against children between 1980 and 1993. He became eligible to be considered for parole in November 2017. The panel needed to consider Mr X's risks between the hearing date and July 2020, when Mr X would be eligible for automatic release. RISK ASSESSMENT Having considered the index offence and the evidence before it, the panel considered Mr X's risk factors to include sexual preoccupation, a sexual interest in children, sexual entitlement, aggression, inappropriate relationships with adults, poor emotional control, a lack of victim awareness and poor problem-solving skills. Evidence was presented concerning Mr X's compliance in custody and the completion of some offending behaviour work to address his risks. The panel were also aware of the time that had passed since Mr X committed his offences and his greater maturity now. Mr X has never admitted his guilt of his offences. However, the panel was fully aware of the details of his conviction and worked on the basis that he did commit the acts that he

was convicted of. The panel also had sight of several victim statements and was fully aware of the harm that Mr X caused to his victims. Witnesses described Mr X's positive custodial conduct, his completion of offending behaviour work to address some of the negative aspects of his past and a programme specifically for people who maintain their innocence. Mr X was assessed to have greater insight into the causes of sexual misconduct and to be aware of the harm that sexual offending can cause. Both professional witnesses recommended that Mr X be released. The panel considered the release plan provided by the Offender Manager was robust enough to manage Mr X in the community. The plan included extensive measures to protect the victims, a requirement to be released to a designated address where Mr X could be closely observed and monitored and measures to prevent him from residing, working or having contact with children. Mr X would also be required to disclose future relationships and associations with those who reside with children. DECISION After considering the circumstances of offending, the progress made while in custody, and the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel were satisfied that Mr X was suitable for release. The panel were reassured that there was a comprehensive risk management plan in place that could prevent replication of the circumstances which led to the index offences. Mr X's release is subject to the following licence conditions, which must be strictly adhered to:       To comply with requirements to reside at a designated address, abide by a curfew, be of good behaviour, and report as required for supervision or other appointments To comply with an enhanced form of supervision or monitoring To comply with other identified limitations concerning contacts, activities, residency or exclusion zones To be subject to comprehensive child safeguarding measures To be prohibited from contacting other sex offenders To disclose future relationships and associations with those who reside with children.
