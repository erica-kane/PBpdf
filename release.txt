Name: Miss Jane Bloggs Decision: Release INTRODUCTION Miss Jane Bloggs' case was referred to the Parole Board by the Secretary of State for Justice to consider Miss Jane Bloggs' suitability for release. The case was considered at an oral hearing in October 2017 and then again in May 2018, once further information had been received. The panel could only direct Miss Bloggs' release if it was satisfied that it was no longer necessary for the protection of the public that she remained confined in prison. In reaching its decision, the panel took into account the contents of Miss Jane's dossier of 356 pages, prepared by the Secretary of State. At the hearing, the panel heard oral evidence from Miss Jane's Offender Supervisor and her Offender Manager. The panel also heard evidence from Jane, who was legally represented for the hearing. The panel also had the benefit of four victim personal statements, which the panel considered carefully. Some of the information which the panel had access to could not be shared with Miss Jane Bloggs. SENTENCE DETAILS In September 2010, Miss Bloggs received a determinate sentence of 16 years following conviction for multiple sexual offences committed against children between 1980 and 1993. She became eligible to be considered for parole in November 2017. The panel needed to consider Jane's risks between the hearing date and July 2020, when Miss Jane would be eligible for automatic release. RISK ASSESSMENT Having considered the index offence and the evidence before it, the panel considered Miss Jane Bloggs' risk factors to include sexual preoccupation, a sexual interest in children, sexual entitlement, aggression, inappropriate relationships with adults, poor emotional control, a lack of victim awareness and poor problem-solving skills. Evidence was presented concerning Jane's compliance in custody and the completion of some offending behaviour work to address her risks. The panel were also aware of the time that had passed since Miss Jane Bloggs committed her offences and her greater maturity now. Miss Bloggs has never admitted her guilt of her offences. However, the panel was fully aware of the details of her conviction and worked on the basis that she did commit the acts that she

was convicted of. The panel also had sight of several victim statements and was fully aware of the harm that Miss Bloggs caused to her victims. Witnesses described Miss Bloggs' positive custodial conduct, her completion of offending behaviour work to address some of the negative aspects of her past and a programme specifically for people who maintain their innocence. Jane Bloggs was assessed to have greater insight into the causes of sexual misconduct and to be aware of the harm that sexual offending can cause. Both professional witnesses recommended that Bloggs be released. The panel considered the release plan provided by the Offender Manager was robust enough to manage Miss Bloggs in the community. The plan included extensive measures to protect the victims, a requirement to be released to a designated address where Jane could be closely observed and monitored and measures to prevent her from residing, working or having contact with children. Jane would also be required to disclose future relationships and associations with those who reside with children. DECISION After considering the circumstances of offending, the progress made while in custody, and the evidence presented at the hearing, the panel were satisfied that Miss Jane Bloggs was suitable for release. The panel were reassured that there was a comprehensive risk management plan in place that could prevent replication of the circumstances which led to the index offences. Miss Bloggs' release is subject to the following licence conditions, which must be strictly adhered to:       To comply with requirements to reside at a designated address, abide by a curfew, be of good behaviour, and report as required for supervision or other appointments To comply with an enhanced form of supervision or monitoring To comply with other identified limitations concerning contacts, activities, residency or exclusion zones To be subject to comprehensive child safeguarding measures To be prohibited from contacting other sex offenders To disclose future relationships and associations with those who reside with children.
